Designing Software for CS-330 Comp Graphic and Visualization Project
A significant computer graphics and visualization project, specifically CS-330, presented me with challenges and exhilaration as a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University. To design software, I first understood the objectives and requirements. To create a dynamic 3D scene with OpenGL, I had to carefully plan the scene's layout, functionalities, and interactions.


New Design Skills Developed
I learned about shader programming, texture mapping, and OpenGL lighting in this project. I significantly improved my understanding of rendering objects in a 3D space by writing vertex and fragment shaders. This was a completely new experience. The ability to apply textures and manipulate light sources to create more realistic scenes has also provided me with a valuable skill set. I expect to use it in many future endeavors.


Design Process for the Project
Starting with simple shapes, I added complexity progressively, ensuring a solid foundation for the more complex aspects of the project. I designed my project iteratively and modularly. In addition to modularity in my code, I focused on developing, testing, and refining each component independently before integrating it into the main project. This was so that each element could be developed, tested, and refined separately.


Applying Design Tactics in Future Work
This project showcased several techniques I used for graphics programming and software development, including iterative development and modular design. Software projects can be maintained and scaled more efficiently and effectively through these strategies. As a result of these tactics, I will be able to enhance the development process and the final product's quality in the future.


Developing Programs for the Project
I adopted a structured and incremental development approach since I was unfamiliar with OpenGL and 3D graphics. I began with the basics and added more complex features like buffer objects and shader programs. To bring the designed elements to life, I needed to understand and utilize OpenGL's capabilities.


New Development Strategies Used
It was crucial to understand the rendering process, so I used new strategies throughout this project, such as shader experimentation. I also optimized performance by continuously monitoring and optimizing the rendering process, which resulted in smoother interactions and visual appeal. Not only were these strategies intended to solve problems, but they were also meant to help us understand 3D graphics principles.


Iteration in Development
My development process involved iteration. I developed, tested, and refined every component I created, whether simple or complex. As a result, every component functioned correctly and looked great, resulting in a cohesive final product.


Evolution of Code Development
As the project progressed, my approach to developing code evolved significantly. I started focusing on functionality but gradually shifted towards efficiency and aesthetics. I regularly refactored and optimized the code to ensure the final product was functional, well-structured, and efficient.


Impact of Computational Graphics on My Goals
A computational graphics course has expanded my career options in areas such as virtual reality, game development, and simulation for computer science students. These skills provide a strong foundation in computer science, which is especially valuable in technology-focused careers.

Educational Pathway Enhancement
I have enriched my educational pathway by deepening my understanding of core computer science concepts through computational graphics. Through this program, I have gained experience with complex data structures, sophisticated algorithms, and essential software design patterns. This contributes to a well-rounded knowledge of computer science.


Professional Pathway and Future Applications
Through this project, students can learn computational graphics and visualization skills that may be useful for software development, particularly in fields that require 3D visualizations like architectural design, video game development, and virtual reality. In cutting-edge technology sectors, these skills can provide a solid foundation.
The project I completed in CS-330 Comp Graphic and Visualization has become an essential milestone in my academic career, developing my skills in 3D graphics programming and preparing me for future challenges.
